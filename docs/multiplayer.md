# Multiplayer & social: friends, invites, rooms and chat

> **Canonical copy:** this file lives in the hub repo (`diffenderfer-games/docs/multiplayer.md`).
> `npm run sync-docs` copies it into dg-template games. Edit the hub's copy, never a game's.
> Background and decisions: the hub's `docs/plans/multiplayer.md` (the plan) and
> `docs/plans/multiplayer-impl.md` (the wire contract).

**Rule:** your game never handles identity, friends, chat or moderation. The hub
does all of that. Your game only:

1. calls **`hub.overlay.autoPause(...)`**. **Every game does this, single-player included**;
2. reports **presence** (`hub.presence.set`);
3. and, if it's an online game, handles **launches** (`hub.mp.onLaunch`), plays over
   **hub rooms** or its **own server** (with hub tickets), and sends chat **through the hub**.

## TL;DR: the rules

- **Never show player-typed text that didn't come back from the hub.** Chat is shown
  only after `room.chat()` resolves (or your server's `hub.chat()` says `ok`). Never
  show it optimistically, and never show the draft as "sent".
- **Never build your own text channel between players.** No free-text names, notes,
  lobby titles or chat sent over `room.send`, your WebSocket or `setState`. Text goes
  through `room.chat` / `room.quick` (hub rooms) or `hub.chat()` (own server).
- **No links, emails, phone numbers or social handles in game text.** Developer text
  is checked too: presence `detail` and `quickChat` phrases are filtered when they load.
- **No violent words in your UI copy.** Write "zap", "tag", "knock out" or "out of HP",
  not "kill", "shoot" or "bomb". Kid-safe copy matches what chat softens to.
- **Put `hub.social.openPlayer(...)` on every player name you render.** That is how
  players friend, message, block and report.
- **Free text is only for mutual friends.** Everyone else gets quick-chat phrases and
  emotes. The hub decides; your UI follows `room.info.chatMode` / `hub.social.chatMode()`.
- **Register `hub.mp.onLaunch` at boot** (within 8 s) if your game has `game.multiplayer`.
- **Call `hub.mp.setBusy(true)` during a live online match**, and `false` after it.
- **Leaving never ends the match while a human remains.** When a seat goes `away`, your
  computer player takes it (or it waits out the grace); on `back` the player has control
  again ([Resilience](#resilience-away-back-gone)).
- **Online games ship with the required hub test scenarios** ([Testing](#12-testing-required)).
- **Single-player games can race** with no netcode: declare `game.race`, put a Race button on the menu,
  and build the puzzle from the shared seed ([Races](#14-races-single-player-games-go-multiplayer)).

Import from the npm client `@diffenderfer-games/hub` (TypeScript games) or from the hub (plain JS):

```ts
import { hub, HubError, ContentRejectedError, OfflineError } from '@diffenderfer-games/hub'; // dg-template games
// import { hub, ContentRejectedError } from '/_hub/hub.js';                         // plain-JS static games
import type { HubRoom, Launch, RoomInfo, PresenceInput } from '@diffenderfer-games/hub'; // types come along too
```

Every call below is safe to make before the hub's live runtime (`/_hub/social.js`) has
loaded, and when it never loads (offline, `hub: false`, local `vite dev`). See
[Offline behaviour](#offline-and-no-hub-behaviour).

## Architecture

```
your game (browser)                         the hub (same origin)
  hub.overlay / presence / social / mp ──►  /_hub/social.js runtime (window.__HUB_RT__)
  hub.rooms ─────────────────────────────►    one WebSocket per tab: /_ws
                                               presence · friends · DMs · invites · parties
                                               hub relay rooms · kid-safe chat filter
  own-server games only:
  hub.mp.ticket() ──► your server ──────────► hub-server.mjs: verifyTicket (offline),
     (60 s identity ticket)                     chat() / results() / recent() over loopback
```

- **The client (`@diffenderfer-games/hub`) is thin.** `hub.presence`, `hub.social`,
  `hub.mp`, `hub.rooms` and `hub.notify` forward to the runtime the hub injects into
  every game page (`/_hub/social.js`). So social features update without upgrading
  your game.
- **The hub draws the UI:** the Friends card in the menu (it opens the Friends window), player cards, chat, invite
  toasts, the invite picker and notification settings. Your game opens those screens
  (`hub.social.open*`) and reacts to their results (launches).
- **Players:** a **claimed** account can do everything. A **guest** can create and join
  rooms with quick-chat only, but can't friend, invite, DM or get notifications. A
  **suspended** account is single-player only: every social/multiplayer call fails with
  `code:'suspended'`.

---

## 1. Do I need multiplayer? Choosing a transport

Friends, presence, DMs and invites-*to-other-games* work in **every** game with no
code. You only need this doc's online parts when players play **together inside your
game**.

| Your game is… | Transport | `game.type` | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Turn-based, board/card, party, co-op puzzle, trading, "shared counter" | **`hub-rooms`** | `static` | No server to write. The host player's browser runs the rules and the hub relays. |
| Real-time but forgiving (co-op, casual races) with ≤8 players | **`hub-rooms`** | `static` | Fine if a cheating host doesn't matter. Results are untrusted. |
| Real-time physics, competitive, ranked, or anything a cheater would ruin | **`own-server`** | `process` | Your server is the authority. Trusted results feed hub stats and server-only boards. |
| Needs lockstep, tick-rate netcode, >8 players, or persistent worlds | **`own-server`** | `process` | Hub rooms cap at 8 seats and 30 msgs/s per seat. |

- **Hub rooms are not cheat-proof.** The host is a player's browser. Never post
  competitive scores from a hub-room match to a board that matters.
- **Keep `type: "static"` unless this table says `own-server`.** An own-server game is a
  process app; read the host's `HANDOFF.md` (process-app contract) first.

---

## 2. The `game.multiplayer` block

Add it to the `game` block in `package.json`. It makes your game an invite/join
target: the catalog shows an **Online** tag, and the invite picker lists the game.

```jsonc
"game": {
  "type": "static",
  "title": "Duel Dots",
  "serveDir": "dist",
  "multiplayer": {
    "lobby": "?mp=lobby",          // URL suffix the hub opens for invites/joins (relative)
    "players": [2, 4],             // [min, max], within 1..8
    "transport": "hub-rooms",      // "hub-rooms" (static) | "own-server" (process apps only)
    "invites": true,               // appear in the invite picker (default true)
    "join": true,                  // friends may Join from your presence (default true)
    "spectate": false,             // friends may Watch (default false)
    "tournaments": false,          // plays tournament matches and reports the winner (§15)
    "modes": [{ "key": "ranked", "title": "Ranked", "players": [2, 2] }],   // optional
    "quickChat": ["Nice move!", "Your turn"],                               // optional extra phrases
    "chatAllow": ["shot"]                                                   // optional soften exceptions
  }
}
```

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `lobby` | `""` | Appended to `/<slug>/`. Must be relative: no leading `/`, no `..`, ≤200 chars. The hub adds `hub_launch=<token>` to it, so `?mp=lobby` becomes `?mp=lobby&hub_launch=…`. Your game must recognise the lobby URL and show its lobby. |
| `players` | `[2, 8]` | `[min, max]`, integers within 1..8. `max` caps party size and room seats. `min` is checked by `room.start()`. |
| `transport` | `hub-rooms` (static) / `own-server` (process) | `own-server` on a static app is rejected (falls back to `hub-rooms` with a warning). `hub.rooms.create` only works for `hub-rooms` games. |
| `invites` | `true` | `false` hides the game from the invite picker and `hub.mp.invite` fails with `not_supported`. |
| `join` | `true` | Friends see **Join** when your presence says `joinable`. |
| `spectate` | `false` | Friends see **Watch** when your presence says `watchable`, and `rooms.join(code, {spectate:true})` is allowed (≤20 spectators). |
| `quickMatch` | `false` | Reserved (quick match isn't built yet). |
| `tournaments` | `false` | Tournaments can be played in this game: it plays a 1v1 match from a `host`/`guest` launch and reports the winner (§15). Race games don't need it. |
| `modes` | `[]` | ≤16 entries: `key` matches `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,32}`, `title` ≤40 chars, optional `players`. Invites and rooms may name a `mode`; an undeclared mode is `bad_mode`. |
| `quickChat` | `[]` | ≤24 phrases, each ≤40 chars. Each is checked once at load (surface `quick_phrase`, **no softening**), and a phrase that fails is dropped with a warning in the host log. Ids are `g:<slug>:<index>` (the index in **your** array). |
| `chatAllow` | `[]` | ≤20 single lowercase words from the hub's **soften list** that your rooms' chat may keep unchanged (e.g. `"shot"` for a pool game). Applies only to your rooms' chat and your server's `hub.chat()`, never to DMs. Words that aren't soften-list entries are dropped at load. You can never allow a reject-list word. |

Problems are **warnings, never fatal**: a bad field falls back to its default. Check
the host log (`[registry] … warning`) after adding the block.

---

## 3. Presence

Friends see what you're doing in the hub menu ("🟢 Playing **Duel Dots** · Level 3").
Report it at natural screen changes. Calls are cheap, deduped and coalesced (150 ms),
so call `set` whenever your state changes.

```ts
hub.presence.set({ kind: 'menu' });                                       // title screen
hub.presence.set({ kind: 'playing', detail: 'Level 3 – Ice Cave' });      // single-player run
hub.presence.set({ kind: 'lobby', detail: 'Waiting for players', room: code,
                   joinable: true, public: true, openSeats: 2 });         // online lobby
hub.presence.set({ kind: 'playing', detail: 'Duel · round 2', room: code,
                   joinable: false, watchable: true });                   // online match
hub.presence.clear();                                                     // back to { kind: 'menu' }
```

`PresenceInput`:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `'menu' \| 'lobby' \| 'playing' \| 'watching' \| 'away'`. With several tabs, the most engaged wins: playing > watching > lobby > menu > away. A hidden or 5-minute-idle tab becomes `away` automatically. |
| `detail?` | ≤40 chars of **your** text. It is filtered without softening; a rejected detail is dropped silently and logged. Keep it factual: no player-typed text, no violent words. |
| `joinable?` / `watchable?` | Lights up **Join** / **Watch** for friends (needs `room`; `watchable` also needs `multiplayer.spectate`). |
| `room?` | Opaque join info, ≤64 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9_:-]`, visible to friends. A Join/Watch launch hands it back to the joiner as `launch.room`. **Hub rooms fill this in automatically** for seated players. Own-server games set it to their room code. |
| `public?` / `openSeats?` | A public lobby with open seats can trigger `lobby_open` notifications ([§5](#5-notifications--lobby_open)). |
| `mode?` | A mode key, shown to friends. |

- `game` and the game's title are added by the hub from your slug.
- **Privacy is automatic.** Only friends see presence, a player can hide it entirely
  (privacy "nobody"), and blocks hide it both ways. You never filter anything yourself.

---

## 4. Pausing when the hub opens (every game)

**Rule:** every game calls `hub.overlay.autoPause` once at boot. This includes
single-player and turn-based games. When the player opens the hub menu, a chat, a player
card, an invite or the notification panel, the game must not keep running underneath.

```ts
hub.overlay.autoPause({
  pause: () => game.pause(),     // do exactly what your own pause does (show your pause screen)
  // turn-based / idle games only:
  // resume: () => game.resume(), resumeOnClose: true,
});
```

- **`open`** fires when the first piece of hub UI opens (the stack goes 0 → 1).
  **`close`** fires when the last one closes. Nested dialogs (drawer → card → chat)
  produce **one** open/close pair.
- **Action games: leave `resumeOnClose` off** (the default). Show your pause screen
  so the player resumes deliberately. Turn-based and idle games may pass
  `resumeOnClose: true` with a `resume`.
- **Online matches can't pause.** While you've called `hub.mp.setBusy(true)`, events
  carry `canPause: false` and `autoPause` does **not** call `pause()`. The game keeps
  simulating, and the hub shows "Your match is still going!".
- **Input is handled for you.** While hub UI is open, the hub disables your `play` input
  group (so the paddle doesn't move while the player types). Your own
  `hub.input.enable/disable('play')` calls made meanwhile are recorded, and the last one
  is applied on close. So a game that pauses itself on `open` stays paused.
- `autoPause` registered while UI is already open pauses immediately. It returns a
  detach function.

Lower-level API, if you need more than `autoPause`:

```ts
const off = hub.overlay.on('open', (e) => {   // e: { reason, canPause }
  // reason: 'menu' | 'chat' | 'dialog' | 'keyboard' | 'invite' | 'notify'
  if (e.canPause) pauseGame(); else showToast('Match still running!');
});
hub.overlay.on('close', (e) => showPauseScreen());
hub.overlay.isOpen;      // true while any hub UI covers the game
hub.overlay.canPause;    // false during setBusy(true)
// window events too: 'hub:overlay-open' / 'hub:overlay-close' (detail = the same payload)
```

---

## 5. Notifications & `lobby_open`

Players opt in (everything is off by default) from **Notifications** in the hub menu,
or with one tap on the **"🔔 Get a buzz…"** card in the Friends window (it turns on
messages, requests and any-friend-online for that device). Alerts buzz the phone
when the site is in the background or closed; tapping one focuses the open app and
opens the chat / player card in place (or opens the site if nothing is running).

| Kind | What | Your part |
|---|---|---|
| `dm` | a friend's message (push only when no tab is visible) | nothing |
| `friend_request` | a new friend request | nothing |
| `friend_online` | any friend, or a chosen friend, comes online | nothing |
| `lobby_open` | **someone is waiting in a public lobby of a game I follow** | report lobby presence (below) + a 🔔 button |

**Put a 🔔 in your lobby** that opens the hub's settings focused on your game:

```ts
bellButton.onclick = () => hub.social.openNotify({ game: hub.slug ?? undefined });
```

**A lobby triggers `lobby_open`** when a **claimed** player's presence is all of these,
and holds for 15 s:

```ts
hub.presence.set({ kind: 'lobby', room: code, public: true, joinable: true, openSeats: 3 });
```

- Guests, private and full rooms never trigger it, and neither do players who hide
  their presence.
- Each recipient gets at most one per game every 15 minutes. It never goes to the
  creator, to people who blocked them, or to anyone already in your game.
- Tapping it opens `/<slug>/?hub_join=<userId>`. The hub turns that into a **`join`
  launch** with `launch.room` = your presence `room`, or tells the player "That game
  already started" if the lobby is gone. Keep `openSeats` and `joinable` honest, and
  set `joinable: false` the moment the match starts.

---

## 6. The launch contract

A **launch** is the hub bringing a player into your game for a reason: an invite was
sent or accepted, a friend tapped Join or Watch, or a `lobby_open` notification was
tapped.

```ts
interface Launch {
  kind: 'host' | 'guest' | 'join' | 'watch';
  game: string; mode?: string;
  partyId?: string; party?: Party; joinInfo?: Record<string, string> | null;  // invites
  room?: string;                                                              // join / watch
  host?: PlayerLite;     // guest: who invited you
  target?: PlayerLite;   // join / watch: whose room (or who made the invite link)
  via?: 'link' | 'rejoin'; // join / watch: opened from an invite link, or taking back a held seat
}
```

| `kind` | When | What your game does |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | **I** sent an invite (from the hub UI or `hub.mp.invite`) | Show the lobby and **create the room** for party `partyId` (or share the room you're already in). |
| `guest` | I **accepted** an invite | Show the lobby. Join `joinInfo` if it's already there, otherwise wait for `hub.mp.onJoinInfo`. |
| `join` | I tapped **Join** on a friend, or a `lobby_open` notification | Join `launch.room`. |
| `watch` | I tapped **Watch** | Join `launch.room` as a spectator. |
| `join`, `via: 'link'` | I opened an **invite link** and a seat was free | Join `launch.room` (the same code path as Join). |
| `watch`, `via: 'link'` | I opened an invite link to a full or started game | Join `launch.room` as a spectator. |
| `join`, `via: 'rejoin'` | I **reopened** your game while still holding a seat (reload, closed tab, the hub's Rejoin toast) | Join `launch.room`: the hub hands the seat back. |

**How players arrive:**
- **From another game or the catalog,** the hub navigates to `/<slug>/<lobby>` with a
  single-use `hub_launch=<token>` (2 minutes, stripped from the URL on load). The runtime
  redeems it and fires `onLaunch`.
- **Already in your game,** the launch fires **in place** with no reload. Your
  handler must cope with being in a menu, a lobby or an existing room.
- **From an invite link** (`/<slug>/<lobby>?hub_link=<token>`), the runtime opens the
  link (`POST /mp/links/:token/open`), strips it from the URL and fires a `join` or
  `watch` launch with `via: 'link'`. A dead link shows "That invite link has expired."
  (or "That game has ended.", or that it's full) and fires no launch.
- **Back after a reload or a closed tab,** the hub sees the seat the player still holds
  in this game and fires a `join` launch with `via: 'rejoin'`. On any other page it
  shows a "Your *game* game is still on" toast with **Rejoin**.

**Rules:**

1. **Register `hub.mp.onLaunch` at boot, synchronously, before any `await`.** Launches
   that arrive before you register are buffered and delivered when you do. If a
   multiplayer game hasn't registered within **8 seconds** of a launch arriving, the
   player sees "This game didn't open its lobby", which counts as a bug in your game.
2. **Open the lobby URL.** When the page loads with your `lobby` suffix (e.g.
   `?mp=lobby`), go straight to the lobby screen, not the title screen.
3. **Make the handler idempotent.** A second invite reuses the same party and fires
   another `host` launch, and a guest may get both `launch.joinInfo` and a later
   `onJoinInfo`. Guard with "already in a room / already joining".
4. **Leave guard:** call `hub.mp.setBusy(true, { label: 'a match' })` when a live online
   match starts and `setBusy(false)` when it ends. While busy, any navigation the hub
   starts (accepting an invite, Join, switching games or going Home from the menu) first
   asks "Leave your match? You're in a match. Leaving now may end it for everyone."
   The label reads as a noun phrase after "You're in ...". Busy also makes overlay
   events report `canPause: false`.

```ts
hub.mp.onLaunch((l) => { void handleLaunch(l); });          // at boot, first thing
hub.mp.onJoinInfo(({ partyId, info }) => { if (info.room) void joinRoom(info.room); });
```

The full handlers are in the skeletons: [hub rooms §8](#skeleton-host-authoritative-hub-room-game)
and [own server §9](#client-side-own-server).

---

## 7. Invites & parties

- **Invite from your lobby** with the hub's friend picker (recommended):
  `hub.social.openInvite()`, or `hub.social.openInvite({ mode: 'ranked' })`. The picker
  lists online friends and calls the hub for you.
- **Your own friend list?** `await hub.social.friends()` returns `FriendEntry[]` (each
  `{id, username, avatar, presence, …}`). Call it once; after that
  `hub.social.on('friends', list => …)` hands you every change (presence included), so
  render from the event's list rather than calling `friends()` again. And `hub.mp.invite(userId, { mode })` sends one.
  It rejects with `HubError` (`code`: `cannot_invite`, `party_full`, `already_member`,
  `not_supported`, `bad_mode`, `rate_limited`, `claim_required`). Show `err.message`.
- **What happens:** the inviter gets a "waiting…" chip and a **`host` launch** (in place).
  The invitee gets a toast with Accept/Decline. Accept leads to a **`guest` launch** in
  your lobby. Decline, expiry (2 min) and cancel tell the inviter "can't play right now",
  and nobody navigates.
- **Parties:** an invite creates (or reuses) the inviter's **party** for your game: 2..`players[1]`
  friends (≤8) who move between games together. `launch.party` / `hub.mp.party()` give
  `{id, game, mode, leaderId, members, joinInfo}`. Subscribe with
  `hub.social.on('party', p => …)`. The leader role passes on when the leader leaves,
  and empty or 2-hour-idle parties dissolve.
- **Join info:** the party leader publishes where to connect with
  `hub.mp.setJoinInfo(partyId, { room: code })` (≤8 keys, values ≤64 chars). Every member
  on the party's game page gets `hub.mp.onJoinInfo({partyId, info})` (other games' pages
  don't: the info is where to connect in that game). **Hub-rooms games get this for free:**
  `hub.rooms.create({ partyId })` from the leader sets `{room: code}` automatically.
- **"Play again"** keeps the party: create a new room with the same `partyId` (or
  `setJoinInfo` with the new code), and members follow `onJoinInfo`.
- Guests can't invite or be invited. They join by room code, public list or an invite link.

### Invite links

Any player in a room can share a link that drops whoever opens it into that room:
as a player while a seat is free (lobby), otherwise as a spectator.

- **The hub UI does it for you:** `hub.social.openInvite()` shows an **Invite link**
  section (Create, Copy, Share, Revoke) when the player is in a room of this game.
- **Your own button:** `const { url, token, expiresAt } = await hub.mp.inviteLink();`
  (absolute `url`, reused while it lives) and `await hub.mp.revokeInviteLink(token)`.
  Rejects with `HubError`: `not_in_room` (open a room first), `too_many_links` (10 live
  links per account), `rate_limited`, `claim_required` (guests can't make links).
- **Which room:** a hub room is the seat the player holds; an own-server game's is the
  `room` its presence reports. Report it honestly with `joinable` / `watchable`: the
  opener joins when `joinable`, watches when `watchable`, and is told it's full otherwise.
- **Nothing new to handle:** openers arrive as ordinary `join` / `watch` launches with
  `via: 'link'` and `target` = the link's creator.
- **Safety:** links expire after 24 h; the creator or the room's host can revoke them;
  a block between the opener and the creator (or anyone seated) reads as an expired
  link; openers get the room's usual chat rules (quick-chat unless everyone is a mutual
  friend) and are **never** auto-friended. The /parents page explains links.
- **REST:** `POST /mp/links {game}`, `GET /mp/links?game=`, `DELETE /mp/links/:token`,
  `POST /mp/links/:token/open` (a launch ticket).

## 8. Hub rooms (no server)

The hub relays messages and holds a small shared state. **The host player's browser
runs the rules** (or every client does, in `relay` mode). There's no server code in
your game.

### API

```ts
// create / join / list
const room = await hub.rooms.create({ mode?, public?: false, maxPlayers?, model?: 'host', hostMigration?: 'grace', partyId? });
const room = await hub.rooms.join(codeOrId, { spectate?: false });   // 5-char code like 'K7QPA', or room.info.id
const rooms: RoomInfo[] = await hub.rooms.list({ mode? });           // public rooms in the lobby phase, this game

// the room handle (HubRoom)
room.info      // RoomInfo: { id, code, game, mode?, hostId, public, phase: 'lobby'|'playing'|'ended',

All methods reject with `HubError` / `ContentRejectedError` / `OfflineError`.

| Error `code` | When |
|---|---|
| `room_not_found` (404) | Unknown or ended room, or someone in it blocked you (indistinguishable on purpose). |
| `room_full`, `in_progress` (409) | New seats only exist in the lobby phase, up to `maxPlayers`. |
| `banned` (403) | You were kicked from this room. |
| `not_ready` (409) | `start()` needs ≥ `players[0]` seats and every other seat ready and connected. |
| `content_rejected` (422) | `chat()` refused: see [§10](#10-chat-in-your-game). |
| `suspended` (403) | The account is suspended. Show "Online play isn't available" and stay single-player. |

### Message models

| `model` | `send()` without `to` | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| **`host`** (default) | A guest's message goes to the **host only**. The host's message goes to **everyone else**. | Host-authoritative: guests send intents, the host validates them and publishes state. |
| **`relay`** | Goes to **everyone, including the sender**, in one ordered stream (`seq`). Anyone may `setState`. | Deterministic games where every client applies the same ordered inputs. |

`send(data, { to: userId })` addresses one seat in either model. Spectators receive
unaddressed messages and state only, and can't send.

### State vs messages

- **`setState`** is for **truth that late joiners need**: the board, scores, whose turn
  it is, the phase of your round. It's replayed to anyone who joins or reconnects. Keep
  it small (≤32 KB total) and patch it: `setState({ turn: 2 })` merges, and
  `setState({ ghost: null })` deletes `ghost`.
- **`send`** is for **events**: intents ("I clicked", "move left"), effects, pings. The
  last 200 messages are replayed on rejoin, filtered to what that seat could see.
- Never put player-typed text in either.

### Lobby, reconnect, spectators, ending

- **Lobby:** seats are `{userId, name, avatar, ready, connected, graceEndsAt?, data?}`.
  The host role passes to the longest-seated connected player once the host's seat is
  freed (they left, or their grace ran out). With `hub.rooms.create({ hostMigration: 'drop' })`
  it passes as soon as the host drops mid-match (for games whose whole truth is in
  `setState`). A room never closes because its host left.
- **Socket drops** (wifi blip, laptop sleep) are handled for you: the runtime
  reconnects and re-joins, your seat is reclaimed and you get current state plus the
  messages you missed. The seat shows `connected: false` (with `graceEndsAt`) meanwhile,
  and is held **3 minutes while playing** and **10 s in the lobby**. If the seat can't
  be reclaimed (the grace ran out, the room closed, or the host restarted), the room
  fires `closed` with reason `gone`.
- **Page reloads and closed tabs:** the hub hands the seat back with a `join` launch
  (`via: 'rejoin'`), so a game that handles Join needs nothing else.
  `hub.rooms.reclaim()` does the same on demand. Your seat is keyed by user id, so any
  tab or device reclaims it. A second tab taking the seat closes the first with
  `other_tab`.
- **Abandoned:** when a dropped seat's grace runs out mid-match (or a player leaves or
  is kicked), everyone gets `abandoned {userId}` and `seat` `gone`. The match goes on:
  the computer keeps the seat (preferred), or the seat forfeits.
- **Empty rooms** close after 2 minutes, and **ended rooms** 2 minutes after `end()`.
- **Spectators** (`multiplayer.spectate`) get state and broadcasts, can't chat or send,
  and are capped at 20.
- **Ending:** the host calls `room.end(results)`. Every seated player becomes a "recent
  player" of the others (so they can friend each other). Results are **untrusted**: the
  hub writes no stats or boards from them. Every client (the host too) gets them once
  in the room's **`ended`** event (`room.on('ended', ({ results }) => showResults(results))`),
  so there is no need to copy them into state first.
  Each client may record its **own** stats with `hub.incrStat` (honor system, like
  single-player).
- **Limits:** 8 seats, 30 msgs/s per seat, 8 KB per message, 32 KB state, 200 open rooms
  per game. Guests may create and join rooms.

### Resilience: away, back, gone

"If someone leaves, the game doesn't end, and they can come back and take control
from the computer." The hub keeps the room going; your game keeps the seat playing.

| `seat` event | When | What your game does |
|---|---|---|
| `away` (`graceEndsAt`) | The player dropped (closed the tab, lost wifi, reloaded) mid-match | The **host** hands the seat to its computer player. No AI? Skip their turns until `back` or `gone` (show "waiting for …"). |
| `back` | They reclaimed the seat (any tab or device) | Stop the computer for that seat; the player controls it again from the current state. |
| `gone` (`reason`) | They left, were kicked, or the grace ran out | The computer keeps the seat for the rest of the match (or the seat forfeits). Never end the match while a human remains. |

Rules:

1. **Pick your host migration.** By default (`grace`) a dropped host stays host for the
   grace (the match waits for their turns, like any away seat with no AI) and the role
   moves once their seat is freed. If your whole truth is in `setState`, create rooms
   with `hostMigration: 'drop'` so another player hosts at once (`room.info.hostId`, in a
   `room` event before the `seat` event). Either way the new host must carry on: from
   `room.state`, or from a private backup the host keeps sending to the next host
   (`send(backup, { to })`), never by ending the match.
2. **Whoever hosts runs the bots.** On every `room` event re-check `room.me.host`;
   seats with `connected: false` (or that went `gone`) are the host's to play.
3. **`back` restores control exactly where the game is**: don't reset the seat; the
   returning player gets the current state with the join.
4. **Reopen = rejoin:** handle `join` launches (you already do, for Join) and the
   returning player lands back in their seat.
5. **Own-server games** do the same on their server: hold a dropped player's seat for
   the grace (3 min), let the server's AI play it, give it back when the same user id
   reconnects (their ticket says who they are), and never end a match while a human is
   connected. Report the room in presence so invite links can find it.

```ts
room.on('seat', ({ userId, status }) => {
  if (status === 'away' || status === 'gone') bots.take(userId);  // only the host acts on it
  if (status === 'back') bots.release(userId);
});
room.on('room', (info) => { if (room.me.host) bots.adoptAll(info.seats.filter((s) => !s.connected)); });
```

`apps-test/mpdemo` is the reference: its host "clicks" for away seats.

### Skeleton: host-authoritative hub-room game

Drop-in shape for a static game (TypeScript, dg-template). The `apps-test/mpdemo` app
in the hub repo is the complete runnable reference.

## 9. Own-server games

Use this when your server must be the authority ([§1](#1-do-i-need-multiplayer-choosing-a-transport)).
You keep your own netcode. The hub supplies verified identity, presence, invites,
kid-safe chat and trusted results.

### Setup

1. **Process app.** The game block is `type: "process"` with a `start` command that
   binds `PORT`. See the host's `HANDOFF.md` (process-app contract, path handling).
   The host proxies HTTP **and WebSockets** under `/<slug>/` with the prefix stripped,
   so `/<slug>/ws` reaches your server as `/ws`.
2. **Copy in the server SDK:** `server/hub-server.mjs` is not on npm. `npm run
   sync-hub-server` (in dg-template games) copies the build from the sibling host
   checkout (`../diffenderfer-games`, after `npm ci` in its `next/`). It's also served at
   `/_hub/hub-server.mjs`. It has zero dependencies.
3. **Env:** the host injects `GAME_SLUG`, `HUB_URL` (the hub's loopback URL) and
   `HUB_APP_KEY` (your game's private key) into hub-enabled process apps. Without them
   (local dev with no hub), `createHubServer().enabled` is `false` and every call
   degrades: `verifyTicket` gives `null`, `chat` gives `{ok:false, err:{reason:'check_unavailable'}}`
   and `results`/`recent` give `{ok:false, error}`. **Nothing throws.**

```jsonc
"game": {
  "type": "process",
  "title": "Rally Duel",
  "build": "npm run build",
  "start": "node server/index.mjs",
  "healthPath": "/",
  "multiplayer": { "lobby": "?mp=lobby", "players": [2, 2], "transport": "own-server", "spectate": true },
  "leaderboards": [{ "key": "best-rally", "title": "Best Rally", "sort": "desc", "source": "server" }]
}
```

### Tickets (verified identity)

- The browser calls `await hub.mp.ticket()` and sends the result in its first message.
  It's valid for **60 seconds** and for **your slug only**, so fetch a fresh one on
  every (re)connect.
- The server checks it **offline** (an HMAC, no network call) with
  `hub.verifyTicket(t)`, which returns `{uid, name, avatar, guest, slug, exp, n}` or `null`.
- **`uid` is the player's hub user id.** Key seats, reconnects and results by it.
  `name` is their filtered hub username, so display it, never a typed name.
- Guests get tickets too (`guest: true`). Suspended players don't: `ticket()` rejects
  with `code:'suspended'`.

### `hub-server.mjs`

```js
import { createHubServer } from './hub-server.mjs';
const hub = createHubServer();       // { slug, key, url, fetch } default from env

hub.enabled                          // false without the hub env (local dev)
hub.verifyTicket(ticket)             // → { uid, name, avatar, guest, slug, exp, n } | null
await hub.chat({ userId, text, members, context })   // or { userId, quick, members }
  // → { ok: true, text, quick?, softened? } | { ok: false, err: { error, code, reason, hint?, retryAfterMs? } }
await hub.results({ room, mode, players: [{ userId, place, won, stats, scores }] })   // → { ok } | { ok:false, error }
await hub.recent([uidA, uidB])       // "played together" (so they can friend each other) → { ok }
```

- **`chat`:** `members` are the uids who would see the line. Free text is allowed only
  when everyone in `[userId, ...members]` is a mutual friend (and nobody is
  parent-locked or muted). Otherwise send `quick` ids. Your `chatAllow` applies.
  **Relay `result.text`, never the original.** `context` (optional, ≤6
  `{from:'me'|'them', text}`) helps the AI reviewer.
- **`results`** is trusted, posted from your server only. For each listed player it adds
  1 to the `online_games` stat (and to `online_wins` when `won`), increments every
  `stats` key, writes `scores` to your **server-source** boards (best-only, like
  `submitScore`), records recent players and logs the match. ≤16 players, ≤32 keys,
  keys `[A-Za-z0-9_.:-]`, finite numbers. `room`/`mode` ≤64 safe chars, `place` 1–64.
  Unknown user ids are skipped.
- **Server-source boards:** declare `"source": "server"` on a `game.leaderboards` entry.
  The browser's `hub.submitScore` to that board is refused (403). Only `results().scores`
  write it. That makes the board cheat-resistant.
- The internal API answers only loopback calls with no `x-forwarded-for` and your
  `x-hub-app`/`x-hub-key`. Anything else gets a 404.

### Client side (own server)

```ts
import { hub, type Launch } from '@diffenderfer-games/hub';

let ws: WebSocket | null = null;
let roomCode: string | null = sessionStorage.getItem('room');
let tries = 0;

hub.overlay.autoPause({ pause: () => showPauseScreen() });
hub.mp.onLaunch((l) => { void onLaunch(l); });
hub.mp.onJoinInfo(({ info }) => { if (info.code && !roomCode) join(info.code); });

async function onLaunch(l: Launch): Promise<void> {
  showLobby();
  if (l.kind === 'host') {                     // create on our server, then tell the party where
    const code = roomCode ?? await createRoomOnServer(l.mode);
    if (l.partyId) await hub.mp.setJoinInfo(l.partyId, { code });
  } else if (l.kind === 'guest') {
    if (l.joinInfo?.code) join(l.joinInfo.code);                  // else onJoinInfo follows
  } else if (l.room) {
    join(l.room, l.kind === 'watch');                             // our presence `room` = our code
  }
}

async function connect(): Promise<void> {
  const url = new URL('ws', location.href);                        // → /<slug>/ws (relative!)
  url.protocol = url.protocol === 'https:' ? 'wss:' : 'ws:';
  const ticket = await hub.mp.ticket().catch(() => null);          // fresh every connect (60 s)
  ws = new WebSocket(url);
  ws.onopen = () => { tries = 0; ws!.send(JSON.stringify({ t: 'hello', ticket, room: roomCode })); };
  ws.onmessage = (e) => onServer(JSON.parse(e.data));
  ws.onclose = (e) => {
    if (e.code === 4401) return showError('Please sign in again.');
    const wait = Math.min(8000, 500 * 2 ** tries++) * (0.75 + Math.random() / 2);   // 0.5 s → 8 s, jittered
    showReconnecting();
    setTimeout(connect, wait);
  };
}
// In onServer(): on 'joined' → sessionStorage.setItem('room', code) and
// hub.presence.set({ kind: 'lobby', room: code, joinable, public, openSeats });
// on 'start' → hub.mp.setBusy(true, { label: 'a match' }); on 'end' → setBusy(false).
```

### Server skeleton (`server/index.mjs`)

Static files plus a `ws` server (add `ws` to `dependencies`). Seats are keyed by hub
uid, with a reconnect grace (the pattern 8 Ball Pool uses).

```js
import { createServer } from 'node:http';
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';
import { createHubServer } from './hub-server.mjs';

const hub = createHubServer();
const GRACE_MS = 30_000;
const rooms = new Map();   // code → { code, hostUid, phase, seats: Map<uid, Seat> }
// Seat = { uid, name, ws, connected, graceTimer }

const http = createServer(serveDist);                   // your static dist/ handler
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server: http, path: '/ws', maxPayload: 16 * 1024 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  let me = null;   // { uid, name, guest }
  ws.on('message', async (raw) => {
    let m; try { m = JSON.parse(raw); } catch { return ws.close(4400); }
    if (!me) {
      if (m.t !== 'hello') return ws.close(4400);
      const p = hub.verifyTicket(m.ticket);
      if (p) me = { uid: p.uid, name: p.name, guest: p.guest };
      else if (!hub.enabled) me = { uid: -Math.ceil(Math.random() * 1e9), name: 'Dev', guest: true };  // local dev only
      else return ws.close(4401, 'bad ticket');
      if (m.room) rejoin(m.room, me, ws);
      return;
    }
    const room = roomOf(me.uid);
    switch (m.t) {
      case 'create': return createRoom(me, ws, m.mode);
      case 'join':   return joinRoom(m.code, me, ws, m.watch === true);
      case 'input':  return room && applyInput(room, me.uid, m);   // validate EVERYTHING
      case 'chat': {
        if (!room) return;
        const members = [...room.seats.keys()].filter((u) => u !== me.uid && u > 0);
        const c = await hub.chat({ userId: me.uid, text: m.text, quick: m.quick, members });
        if (c.ok) broadcast(room, { t: 'chat', from: me.uid, text: c.text, quick: c.quick });
        else ws.send(JSON.stringify({ t: 'chat_rejected', id: m.id, ...c.err }));  // {error, code, reason, hint, retryAfterMs}
        return;
      }
    }
  });
  ws.on('close', () => {
    const room = me && roomOf(me.uid);
    const seat = room?.seats.get(me.uid);
    if (!seat || seat.ws !== ws) return;               // an older socket of a reclaimed seat
    seat.connected = false;
    broadcast(room, { t: 'seat', uid: me.uid, connected: false });
    seat.graceTimer = setTimeout(() => abandon(room, me.uid), GRACE_MS);   // AI takeover or forfeit
  });
});

function rejoin(code, me, ws) {
  const seat = rooms.get(code)?.seats.get(me.uid);
  if (!seat) return ws.send(JSON.stringify({ t: 'gone', code }));
  clearTimeout(seat.graceTimer);
  if (seat.ws && seat.ws !== ws) seat.ws.close(4000, 'other tab');
  Object.assign(seat, { ws, connected: true });
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({ t: 'snapshot', state: snapshotOf(rooms.get(code)) }));   // full catch-up
}

async function endMatch(room, placings) {              // placings: [{ uid, place, won, rally }]
  broadcast(room, { t: 'end', placings });
  const real = placings.filter((p) => p.uid > 0);
  await hub.results({
    room: room.code, mode: 'duel',
    players: real.map((p) => ({ userId: p.uid, place: p.place, won: p.won, stats: { rallies: p.rally }, scores: { 'best-rally': p.rally } })),
  });                                                   // also records recent players
}

http.listen(Number(process.env.PORT), '127.0.0.1');
```

- **Presence and Join/Watch:** the hub has no "publish room" call. The **client** reports
  `hub.presence.set({ kind: 'lobby', room: code, joinable, public, openSeats })`, and a
  friend's Join arrives as a `join` launch with `launch.room = code`. Set `joinable: false`
  once the match starts, and `watchable: true` if you support spectators.
- **Reconnect rules:** keep the seat for the grace window, accept the same `uid` from
  any socket, close the older socket, and send a full snapshot. The client backs off
  0.5 s → 8 s with jitter, with a fresh ticket each time. Show "Reconnecting…" rather
  than ending the match.
- **Ratings/Elo** aren't built yet. Use `stats` and server-source boards.

## 10. Chat in your game

**Never roll your own text channel.** Use `room.chat` / `room.quick` (hub rooms) or
`hub.chat()` on your server. The hub filters every line *before* anyone sees it: word
lists, personal-info and link detectors, spam and caps checks, an optional AI reviewer,
strikes and mutes.

### Who may type

The effective **chat mode** is the strictest of these:

| Mode | Meaning | Your UI |
|---|---|---|
| `on` | Everyone present is a **mutual friend** of everyone else, all claimed, nobody parent-locked or muted, and the site allows it | text box **and** quick-chat chips |
| `quick` | Anyone else (strangers, guests, a parent-locked player, a muted sender, site in `HUB_CHAT=quick`) | **quick-chat chips only**, with the tooltip "Typing is only for when everyone here is friends." |
| `off` | Site chat switched off (`HUB_CHAT=off` or the admin switch) | hide chat. Optionally show "Chat is turned off right now." |

- **Hub rooms:** use `room.info.chatMode` (authoritative, updated with every `room`
  event).
- **Own server or elsewhere:** `hub.social.chatMode(otherUserIds)` is a client-side
  estimate (`'off'` until the runtime loads). It's conservative: `'on'` only for a
  one-to-one conversation with a friend — a group of three or more starts at `'quick'`,
  because a client can't see whether *other* players are friends with each other. The
  server's `hub.chat()` result is final: free text in a quick-only room is refused with
  `reason: 'not_friends'` (DMs use `'quick_only'`). Treat both as "switch this chat to
  chips".
- **Hub-room spectators** can't chat. An own-server game may let spectators chat, but
  every line still goes through `hub.chat()` with the spectators included in `members`.

### Quick-chat phrases & emotes

Phrases travel as **ids** and every client renders them from the id:

- **Hub phrases (stable ids):** `hi` Hi! · `gg` Good game! · `gl` Good luck! · `nice` Nice one! ·
  `wow` Wow! · `thanks` Thanks! · `yw` You're welcome! · `oops` Oops! · `sorry` Sorry! ·
  `ready` I'm ready! · `wait` Wait for me! · `brb` Be right back · `back` I'm back! ·
  `go` Let's go! · `rematch` Rematch? · `play` Want to play? · `yes` Yes · `no` No ·
  `maybe` Maybe · `fun` That was fun! · `help` Help me! · `follow` Follow me! · `bye` Bye! ·
  `later` See you later!
- **Emotes:** `e:😀` `e:😂` `e:😮` `e:😢` `e:😎` `e:🤔` `e:👍` `e:👏` `e:🎉` `e:❤️` `e:🔥` `e:⭐`
- **Your phrases:** `game.multiplayer.quickChat[i]` becomes `g:<slug>:<i>`.
- The full id → text map is in `GET /_api/social/config` (`quickChat`). Fetch it once,
  or hard-code your chosen subset.
- Pick 6–10 chips that fit your game. Room chat accepts hub phrases, emotes and **your**
  game's phrases.

### Sending and rendering

```ts
async function sendChat(input: HTMLInputElement, sendBtn: HTMLButtonElement): Promise<void> {
  const text = input.value.trim();
  if (!room || !text) return;
  sendBtn.disabled = true; chatStatus.textContent = 'checking…';      // usually < 1 s
  try {
    const shown = await room.chat(text);                          // the delivered text
    input.value = '';                                             // clear ONLY on success
    chatStatus.textContent = shown !== text ? 'Some words were swapped for friendlier ones ✨' : '';
  } catch (e) {
    if (!(e instanceof ContentRejectedError)) { chatStatus.textContent = "Couldn't send — try again."; return; }
    chatStatus.textContent = e.hint ?? "That message can't be sent.";  // keep the draft in the box
    shake(input);
    if (e.retryAfterMs) disableFor(sendBtn, e.retryAfterMs);      // muted / rate_limited: countdown
  } finally {
    if (!sendBtn.dataset.cooldown) sendBtn.disabled = false;
  }
}

// In enter(r): lines arrive for everyone, including the sender, AFTER moderation.
r.on('chat', ({ from, text, quick }) => {
  const line = document.createElement('div');
  line.textContent = `${nameOf(from)}: ${text || quickText(quick)}`;   // textContent, never innerHTML
  chatLog.append(line);
});
```

- **Render only what the hub delivered.** Use the `chat` event (or your server's
  broadcast of `result.text`), never the input value.
- **Rejections** (`ContentRejectedError`, HTTP 422 / a WS ack `content_rejected`):
  keep the draft, shake the input, and show `hint` under it in your danger colour.
  **Never say which word matched**, and don't invent your own wording when `hint` exists.
- `reason` is one of: `link`, `personal_info`, `contact`, `language`, `slur`, `sexual`,
  `grown_up`, `unkind`, `threat`, `drugs`, `spam`, `shouting`, `too_long`, `empty`,
  `chars`, `rate_limited`, `muted`, `check_unavailable`, `chat_off`, `quick_only`,
  `suspended`.
  - `muted` and `rate_limited` carry `retryAfterMs`: show a countdown, keep the chips working.
  - `check_unavailable` means the safety check is down. Keep the draft and offer a retry.
    Quick-chat still works.
- **Softened text:** game-violence words are rewritten, not rejected ("I got shot" →
  "I took damage", "bomb" → "confetti cannon"). The sender sees the softened version
  too. Show the ✨ hint once. Use `chatAllow` if your game genuinely needs a word like
  "shot" (pool).
- **Limits:** room chat ≤120 chars, at most 4 messages per 5 s. Quick-chat counts toward
  the rate too.
- **Own-server rejections:** relay the `err` object to the sender and render it the
  same way: `hint`, keep the draft, honour `retryAfterMs`.

### Copy rules for your own UI

- **No violent words** in buttons, toasts, quick-chat or presence: "zap", "tag", "pop",
  "knock out", "out of HP". The `quickChat` and `detail` checks don't soften. A
  soften-list word there is rejected.
- No links, social handles, ages, schools or "add me on…" anywhere in game text.
- Player names come from the hub (`seat.name`, ticket `name`). Never let players type a
  name that others will see. The hub username is the name.

---

## 11. Showing other players · notification etiquette

**Every name you render opens the player card.** That's the friend/message/block/report
path, and kids need it one tap away:

```ts
function nameButton(seat: { userId: number; name: string }): HTMLButtonElement {
  const b = document.createElement('button');
  b.textContent = seat.name;                                        // textContent: names are data
  b.onclick = () => hub.social.openPlayer({ userId: seat.userId }); // or { username }
  return b;
}
```

- Lobby rosters, scoreboards, chat lines, "X joined" messages and in-world name tags
  all get a card. Hub rooms give you `userId`, and own-server tickets give you `uid`.
- **Avatars:** `seat.avatar` / `PlayerLite.avatar` are preset ids (`a0`…`a23`). The hub
  shows them on its own UI. Show them in yours if you like.
- Other openers: `hub.social.openFriends()`, `openChat(userId)`,
  `openInvite({ userId?, mode? })`, `openSuggest()`, `openNotify({ game? })`. Live data:
  `hub.social.counts()` → `{ online, inGame, friendsOnline }` and
  `hub.social.on('friends' | 'presence' | 'counts' | 'invite' | 'party', cb)`.
  The same are mirrored as window events — `hub:friends`, `hub:presence`, `hub:invite`
  and `hub:launch` (every launch handed to `onLaunch`), with the payload in `e.detail` —
  for code that prefers `addEventListener`.
  A "● 12 playing" badge from `counts().inGame` makes a lobby feel alive.

**Notification etiquette:**

- `hub.notify.setQuiet(true)` during intense play. Toasts collapse into the menu-button
  badge; **invites still show** as a small non-blocking pill. Set it back to `false` on
  menus, pause screens and lobbies.
- `hub.menu.setVisible(false)` during play hides the button. Incoming messages then
  show a tiny corner pip instead of the wiggle. Show the menu again on pause.
- Don't make your own friend/online notifications. The hub's are opt-in and
  rate-limited.

---

## 12. Testing (required)

Every online game ships a **`tests/hub/`** suite that drives the hub test kit through
the scenarios below, and lists them in its README. Offline single-player games only
need scenario 5 (pausing).

### Required scenarios

1. **Invite → jump → accept → lobby:** A (in your game) invites B, who is in **another
   game** (`mpdemo`). B gets the toast and accepts. B lands in your lobby, and both
   `onLaunch`es fire with the right `kind` (`host` / `guest`) and the same `partyId`.
   Both end up in the same room.
2. **Decline, expiry and cancel** each notify the inviter, and nobody navigates.
3. **Leave guard:** B accepts an invite while A's match has `setBusy(true)`. The
   "Leave your match?" dialog appears, and **Stay** keeps the match.
4. **Join and Watch** from a friend's presence land in that room (Watch as a spectator,
   if you support it).
5. **Pause on hub open:** opening the hub menu fires overlay `open` and the game
   pauses. In an online match it keeps running (`canPause: false`). Closing behaves per
   your rule.
6. **Chat:**
   - a rejected message shows the hint and keeps the draft;
   - a softened word shows softened;
   - a room with a non-friend shows quick-chat only;
   - `HUB_CHAT=off` hides chat.
7. **Reconnect:** drop a player mid-match (reload / close and reopen the tab). The
   seat is held and reclaimed with current state.
8. **Suspended player** can't create, join or see the room, and the game shows a
   friendly message and stays playable offline.
9. **Resilience:** mid-match, close B's tab. A gets `seat` `away`; the computer plays
   B's seat (or the seat waits, for games without AI) and the match does **not** end.
   B reopens the game: B is back in the same room and seat (`via: 'rejoin'`), A gets
   `back`, the computer stops and B's input counts again. Repeat with the **host**
   dropping: the host role moves and the match goes on.
10. **Invite link:** A makes a link (the hub's invite dialog or `hub.mp.inviteLink()`);
    C (not a friend) opens it and takes the free seat; once started, D opens it and
    watches; the room is quick-chat only; after A revokes it, opening it says it expired.

Game-specific scenarios go on top (spectator joins mid-round, AI takeover after
`abandoned`, results reach a server-source board, …).

### The hub test kit

It lives in the hub repo (a sibling checkout, `../diffenderfer-games`), in
`test/helpers/`:

| Helper | What |
|---|---|
| `server.mjs` → `startHost({ apps, env, quiet })` | Boots a **real** host (`node src/index.js`) with `HUB_TEST=1`, a temp data dir, a temp apps dir (your dirs linked in) and a free port. Resolves to `{ url, port, dataDir, appsDir, logs, stop }`. It builds your game like production does. Pass `quiet: false` to see the log. |
| `server.mjs` → `MPDEMO_DIR` | The hidden demo game (`apps-test/mpdemo`): a second game to invite from or jump to, and the reference hub-rooms implementation. |
| `client.mjs` → `player(url, name)` / `guest(url)` | A claimed account (password `password1`) or a guest, as an `ApiClient` with its own cookie jar: `.get/.post/.put/.del(path, body)` → `{status, body}` (paths are under `/_api`), `.user`, and `.ws()` → a `/_ws` client (`op(name, d)`, `next(ev)`, `drain()`, `waitClose()`). |
| `client.mjs` → `befriend(a, b)` | Request + accept, so `a` and `b` are mutual friends. |
| `client.mjs` → `safeName(prefix)` | A unique, filter-safe username (letters only, since digit runs trip the username filter). |
| `apps.mjs` → `gameApps({ slug: gameFields })` | Throwaway static games with exactly the `game` block you need. |
| `apps.mjs` → `testAppKey(slug)` | The `HUB_APP_KEY` a test host gives `slug`, for calling `/_api/internal/*` yourself. |

**What `HUB_TEST=1` changes:**
- Rate limits are ×100. Delays and cooldowns are 0, so `lobby_open` is instant and
  presence has no grace.
- Any limit can be overridden with `env: { HUB_LIMITS_JSON: '{"roomGraceMs":500}' }`.
- The AI stage is a deterministic fake: text containing `[[block]]` is blocked and
  `[[aierror]]` simulates an outage.
- Web Push goes to an in-memory outbox.
- Loopback-only test routes are enabled:
  - `POST /_api/test/suspend {userId, ms}` / `POST /_api/test/unsuspend {userId}`
  - `GET /_api/test/alerts/:userId` (notifications raised, e.g. `lobby_open`)
  - `GET /_api/test/push/:userId` (the push outbox)
  - `POST /_api/test/reset-limits`
- `window.__HUB_TEST__` hooks: `lastLaunch`, `overlayLog` (`{ev, reason, canPause, at}[]`)
  and `toasts` (`{kind, title, body}[]`). They're filled when the page pre-defines
  `window.__HUB_TEST__ = {}` before load (`evaluateOnNewDocument`).

**Browser helpers:** the hub's own e2e suite has ready-made puppeteer helpers in
`test/e2e/helpers.mjs`:
- `e2eEnv({ apps })` + `e2e(name, env, fn)` (one host per file, screenshots on failure);
- `newPlayer(name, path)` / `newGuest(path)` (an isolated context each);
- `openHubMenu`, `deepFind` / `deepClick` (searches the hub's shadow roots by selector
  and text) and `waitForTestHook`.

Import them the same way as the kit (example below) to skip the boilerplate. The
hand-rolled version below shows what they do.

### Two-browser pattern (puppeteer-core)

Add `puppeteer-core` as a dev dependency. It drives the system Chrome (set
`CHROME_PATH`). Each player is a separate **browser context**, which means a separate
cookie jar and a separate account.

```js
// tests/hub/invite.test.mjs   —   node --test tests/hub/
import { test, before, after } from 'node:test';
import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
import { resolve } from 'node:path';
import { pathToFileURL } from 'node:url';
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-core';

const HUB = process.env.DG_HOST || resolve('..', 'diffenderfer-games');
const kit = (f) => import(pathToFileURL(resolve(HUB, 'test/helpers', f)).href);
const { startHost, MPDEMO_DIR } = await kit('server.mjs');
const { ApiClient, safeName } = await kit('client.mjs');
const SLUG = 'mygame';
const CHROME = process.env.CHROME_PATH || 'C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe';

let host, browser;
before(async () => {
  host = await startHost({ apps: { [SLUG]: process.cwd(), mpdemo: MPDEMO_DIR } });
  browser = await puppeteer.launch({ executablePath: CHROME, headless: true });
});
after(async () => { await browser?.close(); await host?.stop(); });

/** A signed-in player in their own browser context, on `path`. */
async function playerPage(path) {
  const page = await (await browser.createBrowserContext()).newPage();
  await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() => { window.__HUB_TEST__ = {}; });
  await page.goto(`${host.url}/${path}`);
  const user = await page.evaluate(async (username) => {
    const r = await fetch('/_api/auth/signup', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ username, password: 'password1' }) });
    return (await r.json()).user;
  }, safeName('Kid'));
  await page.reload();                       // the menu + socket pick up the account
  await ready(page);
  return { page, user };
}
/** The hub runtime is mounted and its socket has said hello (counts include me). */
const ready = (page) => page.waitForFunction(() => window.__HUB_RT__?.social.counts().online > 0, { timeout: 20_000 });
const api = (p, method, path, body) => p.page.evaluate(async (method, path, body) =>
  (await fetch('/_api' + path, { method, headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }, body: body && JSON.stringify(body) })).json(),
  method, path, body);
async function befriend(a, b) {
  await api(a, 'POST', '/social/friends', { userId: b.user.id });
  await api(b, 'POST', `/social/friends/${a.user.id}/accept`);
}
/** Click a hub-UI button by its label (hub UI lives in shadow roots). */
const clickHub = (page, label) => page.waitForFunction((label) => {
  const walk = (root) => [...root.querySelectorAll('*')].some((el) =>
    (el.tagName === 'BUTTON' && el.textContent.trim() === label && (el.click(), true)) || (el.shadowRoot && walk(el.shadowRoot)));
  return walk(document);
}, { timeout: 10_000 }, label);
const lastLaunch = (page, kind) => page.waitForFunction((k) => window.__HUB_TEST__?.lastLaunch?.kind === k, { timeout: 10_000 }, kind);

test('invite from my game reaches a friend in another game and both land in my lobby', async () => {
  const a = await playerPage(`${SLUG}/`);
  const b = await playerPage('mpdemo/');
  await befriend(a, b);
  await a.page.evaluate((id) => window.HubSDK.hub.mp.invite(id), b.user.id);
  await lastLaunch(a.page, 'host');                               // in place, no reload
  await Promise.all([b.page.waitForNavigation(), clickHub(b.page, 'Accept')]);   // the invite toast
  assert.match(b.page.url(), new RegExp(`/${SLUG}/`));
  await lastLaunch(b.page, 'guest');
  const [la, lb] = await Promise.all([a.page, b.page].map((p) => p.evaluate(() => window.__HUB_TEST__.lastLaunch)));
  assert.equal(la.partyId, lb.partyId);
  // …then assert through YOUR game's own test hook that both are in the same room.
});

test('opening the hub menu pauses the game', async () => {
  const a = await playerPage(`${SLUG}/`);
  await a.page.evaluate(() => document.querySelector('#hub-menu-root').shadowRoot.querySelector('.toggle').click());
  await a.page.waitForFunction(() => window.__HUB_TEST__.overlayLog.some((e) => e.ev === 'open' && e.reason === 'menu'));
  // …assert your game is paused (e.g. a tick counter stops).
});

test('a suspended player cannot use online play', async () => {
  const a = await playerPage(`${SLUG}/`);
  await new ApiClient(host.url).post('/test/suspend', { userId: a.user.id, ms: 60_000 });
  // REST calls and room ops fail fast with code 'suspended' (the socket was closed with 4003).
  const code = await a.page.evaluate(() => window.HubSDK.hub.mp.ticket().then(() => null, (e) => e.code));
  assert.equal(code, 'suspended');
  // …then click your "Play online" button and assert your friendly message, not a crash.
});
```

- **Chat scenarios:**
  - **link** (`visit example dot com`) → `reason: 'link'`, and the draft stays;
  - **soften** (`i got shot`) → the line shows "took damage";
  - **AI block** (`hello [[block]]`);
  - **non-friends** → `room.info.chatMode === 'quick'`;
  - **chat off:** a second host with `startHost({ apps, env: { HUB_CHAT: 'off' } })`.
- **Expiry:** `startHost({ env: { HUB_LIMITS_JSON: '{"inviteTtlMs":1500}' } })`.
- **Reconnect:** reload the page mid-match (or close it and `newPage()` in the same
  context). Use `HUB_LIMITS_JSON` `roomGraceMs` to test the abandoned path quickly.
- **REST/WS-only tests** (no browser) can use `player()` / `befriend()` / `.ws()`
  directly. The hub's own `test/api/rooms.test.mjs` and `mp.test.mjs` are worked
  examples.

### Manual testing

- Run the host locally with your game linked in:
  `cd ../diffenderfer-games && HUB_TEST=1 HOST_PORT=8099 node src/index.js` (symlink or
  junction your game into its `apps/<slug>`).
- Use **two browsers, or a normal and a private window**: two cookie jars, two
  accounts. Create two claimed accounts, friend them from the hub menu, and walk the
  scenarios. A phone on the LAN makes a good third player.

## Offline and no-hub behaviour

| Call | Without the runtime (offline, `hub:false`, `vite dev`) |
|---|---|
| `hub.overlay.*` | Fully works (local). `setBusy` still sets `canPause`. |
| `presence.set/clear`, `mp.setBusy`, `notify.setQuiet` | Remembered and replayed when the runtime appears. |
| `social.on`, `mp.onLaunch`, `mp.onJoinInfo` | Kept and attached whenever the runtime appears. They never expire. |
| `social.open*` | Wait up to 15 s, then do nothing. |
| `social.friends`, `mp.invite/ticket/setJoinInfo`, `rooms.*`, `race.create/join/list/finish/…` | Wait up to 15 s, then reject with `OfflineError` (immediately when the page isn't hub-injected). |
| `race.define`, `race.on` | Kept and attached whenever the runtime appears. `race.status` is dropped until then (there's no race without it). |
| `social.counts()` / `chatMode()` / `mp.party()` | Zeros / `'off'` / `null`. |

Guard every online entry point with a friendly "Online play needs a connection" when
it rejects with `OfflineError`, and keep single-player working.

---

## 13. Definition of done

Every game:

- [ ] `hub.overlay.autoPause({ pause })` is wired; opening the hub menu pauses the game,
      and closing it shows the pause screen (or resumes, for turn-based/idle games).
- [ ] `hub.presence.set` at natural screen changes (menu / playing / lobby).
- [ ] No violent words, links or contact info in UI copy, presence `detail` or `quickChat`.

Online games, additionally:

- [ ] `game.multiplayer` is declared with the correct `transport`; no warnings in the host log.
- [ ] `hub.mp.onLaunch` is registered at boot; `host` / `guest` / `join` / `watch` all land
      in the right room; the lobby URL opens the lobby; the handler is idempotent.
- [ ] Lobby has **Invite** (`hub.social.openInvite()`) and a 🔔 (`hub.social.openNotify({ game })`).
- [ ] Lobby presence reports `room` / `joinable` / `public` / `openSeats` honestly;
      `joinable: false` once playing.
- [ ] `hub.mp.setBusy(true)` during live matches (`false` after); the game keeps running
      when the menu opens mid-match.
- [ ] `hub.notify.setQuiet(true)` during intense play.
- [ ] Every rendered player name opens `hub.social.openPlayer`.
- [ ] Chat goes only through `room.chat` / `room.quick` / `hub.chat()`; lines render from
      delivered text only; rejections keep the draft and show `hint`; softened text shows the
      ✨ hint; `chatMode` drives text box vs chips vs hidden.
- [ ] No player-typed text crosses `send` / `setState` / your socket.
- [ ] Resilience: leaving never ends a match while a human remains; `seat` `away` hands the
      seat to the computer (or it waits), `back` gives control back; reloads rejoin through a
      `join` launch; a new host carries on from `room.state`.
- [ ] Suspended / guest / offline players get a friendly message, never a crash.
- [ ] Own-server: tickets verified on the server (fresh ticket per connect); results via
      `hub.results()`; competitive boards are `"source": "server"`.
- [ ] `tests/hub/` covers the 10 required scenarios and passes against `startHost`.

## 14. Races (single-player games go multiplayer)

**Rule:** a single-player game (a puzzle, a level, a run) becomes multiplayer by
**racing**: everyone gets the **same** puzzle from a shared seed, the hub shows a
live race HUD, and **the first to finish wins**. Losing (game over, out of lives)
or giving up loses. You write no lobby, no netcode and no results screen.

| The hub does | Your game does |
|---|---|
| Open races list, join by code, invites, Join/Watch from presence, `lobby_open` | a **Race** button on the main menu + a param picker (difficulty, size…) |
| The waiting card (who's in, the 5-char code, Invite, Cancel) | `hub.race.create({ params })` |
| A fresh seed, revealed at the countdown; the 3-2-1-Go | build the puzzle from `seed` + `params` in `start()` |
| The live HUD (names → player cards, progress bars, your declared stats), Give up | `hub.race.status(stats, progress)` on every change |
| The referee (first valid finish wins; lose/forfeit/leave/drop = out) | `hub.race.finish(stats)` / `hub.race.lose(stats)` |
| The result card (Rematch, Done), the race history (drawer, player cards) | `exit()`: go back to your menu |

The full design, the wire contract and the trust limits are in the hub's
`docs/plans/race.md`. The reference game is the hub's `apps-test/racedemo`; the
first real one is The 15 Puzzle (`client/src/routes/Race.tsx`).

### 14.1 Declare `game.race`

```jsonc
"game": {
  "race": {
    "players": [2, 2],                    // [min, max] racers, within 2..8 (default [2, 2])
    "params": [                           // what the creator picks; the server only accepts these values
      { "key": "size", "title": "Board", "default": 4,
        "options": [{ "value": 3, "title": "3x3" }, { "value": 4, "title": "4x4" }] }
    ],
    "stats": [                            // what the HUD + history show (≤8; the HUD shows the first 3)
      { "key": "moves", "title": "Moves" },               // format: int (default) | percent | time | bool | color
      { "key": "pct", "title": "Done", "format": "percent" }
    ],
    "minMs": 3000,                        // a finish sooner than this after the go is held until it has passed
    "lobby": "?race=lobby"                // where race invites / Join land (default)
  }
}
```

- `race: true` is shorthand for all defaults (no params, no stats).
- A game with `race` but no `multiplayer` gets a race-only multiplayer block
  automatically (invites, Join, Watch). A game with both gets a `race` mode added
  to its modes; race invites and launches carry `mode: 'race'`.
- Titles are your text, shown to other players, so they're checked like
  quick-chat phrases (plain ASCII such as `3x3`, no violent words). A failing
  title falls back to its key (see the host log).
- Option values are numbers, booleans or short tokens (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,24}`).

### 14.2 The game-facing API

```ts
hub.race.define({                          // at boot, once (works before the runtime loads)
  start(r) {                               // the countdown began (and again on rematch / after a reload)
    // r: { seed, params, startAt, round, players, roomId, resumed, spectator }
    newPuzzle(seededRng(r.seed), r.params); // SAME seed + params → SAME puzzle for everyone
    lockInputUntil(r.startAt);             // r.startAt is on this page's clock; the hub draws the 3-2-1
  },
  end(result) { stopInput(); },            // decided; the hub shows the result card
  exit() { showMainMenu(); },              // the player pressed Done / Cancel, or the race closed
  hud: { place: 'top' },                   // 'top' | 'bottom' | 'top-left' | … , or false to draw your own
});

startBtn.onclick = () => hub.race.create({ params: { size: 4 }, public: true });  // the hub shows the waiting card
joinBtn.onclick = () => hub.race.browse(); // the hub's "Open races" sheet (or render hub.race.list() yourself)
historyBtn.onclick = () => hub.race.openHistory();

hub.race.status({ moves, pct }, pct);      // on every change: throttled + coalesced by the hub (≤4/s)
await hub.race.finish({ moves, pct: 1 });  // → RaceResult if you won, null if someone beat you
await hub.race.lose({ moves });            // game over: you're out (the last racer still in wins)
await hub.race.forfeit();                  // give up (the HUD has a Give up button too)
hub.race.current();                        // RoomInfo (with .race) or null
hub.race.on('status' | 'start' | 'result' | 'room' | 'closed', cb);
await hub.race.history({ game, with });    // the signed-in player's races
```

- **Stats are numbers, booleans or `#rrggbb` colours, never text** (≤12 keys,
  identifier keys). Text would be a channel between strangers, so the server
  refuses it (`bad_stats`). The hub only renders stats you declared.
- **`progress`** (0..1) drives the HUD bars and places racers who didn't finish.
  Report it if you can (tiles home ÷ total, % of the level).
- **Race launches are the hub's.** An accepted race invite or a friend's Join
  lands on your `race.lobby` URL and the hub joins the race itself, so you don't
  need `hub.mp.onLaunch` for races (your non-race launches still arrive there).
  When your router redirects the lobby URL, **keep its query** (it carries
  `hub_launch` until the hub reads it).
- **Busy and quiet are automatic** while racing (the leave guard says "a race",
  toasts collapse). Don't pause the race when the hub menu opens: it can't wait.
- **Reloads:** the hub re-joins the race seat after a reload and calls `start()`
  again with `resumed: true` and the same seed. Restart the board, or restore the
  player's progress from your own `sessionStorage`.
- **Spectators** (friends who tap Watch) see the HUD; `start` isn't called for them.
- Guests can race (Open races, codes); invites need a claimed account.
  Suspended players can't race.

### 14.3 Fairness: same seed, same puzzle

Everything random about the puzzle must come from `r.seed` + `r.params`:

- Use a small seeded PRNG (e.g. mulberry32) for generation and **never**
  `Math.random()` in anything that changes the puzzle. Cosmetics may stay random.
- If the game already has a daily-challenge seed path, reuse it with the race seed.
- **Real-time games:** spawn timing, enemy AI and physics must be seeded and
  tick-based (fixed timestep), not frame-time based, or the two runs drift apart.
  When that's out of reach, race on the deterministic part (the same level
  layout) and say so in your docs.
- The seed is only revealed when the countdown starts, so nobody can pre-solve.

### 14.4 Trust

Reports come from the players' browsers. The hub measures time itself, holds
finishes until `minMs`, accepts one result per racer and only declared params,
and rate-limits status, but a determined cheater can still call `finish()`.
Races are for fun: they write the race history, never leaderboards or stats.
(Own-server games could verify finishes on their server later; see race.md.)

### 14.5 Testing

Use the hub test kit (§12) with your game linked into `startHost`, two players:
Race button → create → the other joins (Open races or code) → both `start()`s
got the same seed and built the same puzzle → a status reaches the other's HUD
(`#hub-social-layer >>> .so-hud`) → finish → "You won! 🏆" on one, "<name> won"
on the other → `hub.race.history()` has it. Plus Give up / lose → the other wins.
The hub's `test/e2e/race.test.mjs` and The 15 Puzzle's `tests/hub/race.test.mjs`
are worked examples. `HUB_LIMITS_JSON: '{"raceCountdownMs":1200}'` keeps tests quick.

**Making room for the race HUD.** The hub keeps the HUD clear of its own menu
button (it narrows or drops below it), and tells the game where the HUD sits so
your top/bottom UI can move out of its way:

- CSS variables on `<html>`: `--hub-race-hud-top` / `--hub-race-hud-bottom`, the px
  the HUD covers from that edge (`0px` when there is none), e.g.
  `.topbar { top: calc(8px + var(--hub-race-hud-top, 0px)); }`;
- `--hub-race-hud-left` / `--hub-race-hud-right`: its horizontal span (px from each
  side of the screen to the HUD), so a corner HUD only moves when it actually
  sits under the race HUD (e.g. a left-corner block narrower than
  `--hub-race-hud-left` can stay put);
- a window event `hub:race-hud` with `{ visible, place, top, bottom, left, right }` whenever it changes.

There is no separate Give up to build: the HUD has it. Stats with `format: 'color'`
show as a colour swatch in the HUD and on the result card.

**Race game definition of done:**

- [ ] `game.race` declared (params, stats, `minMs`); no registry warnings.
- [ ] A **Race** button on the main menu → a params picker → `hub.race.create`
      (plus `hub.race.browse()` / `openHistory()` buttons).
- [ ] `hub.race.define({ start, end, exit })` at boot; the puzzle comes from `seed` + `params` only.
- [ ] `status()` on every change (declared stats + progress); `finish()` / `lose()` at the end.
- [ ] Input locked until `startAt`, and after `end`.
- [ ] Works on a 390 px phone with the HUD showing (leave room at the top, or pick another `hud.place`).
- [ ] A `tests/hub/` race scenario (two players race; give up → the other wins).

## 15. Tournaments

Players start tournaments from **Play online** (the home page card, the menu's row,
or `hub.social.openPlayOnline()`): a bracket of 1v1 matches in one game, or a random
game from a set (once, or per match). Single elimination, or double/triple
elimination with **redemption brackets** for players who have lost; seeded at random
or by wins in those games; started at a set time or as soon as enough players sign
up; **open** (listed on the site, anyone signs up, guests too) or **closed** (seen
only by invited friends and holders of the creator's link). The quickest is two taps:
**Quick 1v1** → pick a game → a public 1v1, single elimination, listed for anyone.

A match that is ready must be played within its window (default 10 minutes): the
absent player is warned shortly before the deadline, then forfeits to the one who has
the game open; if neither turned up, the better seed goes through. A match that started
(or with both players there) runs until its result, or 90 minutes, after which the
better seed goes through. Players who have blocked each other never meet.

### 15.1 Which games

| Game | What it must do |
|---|---|
| **Race games** (`game.race` for two racers) | Nothing. A match is a race the hub referees, from an ordinary race launch (`mode: 'race'`). |
| **Hub-room and own-server games** | Declare `"tournaments": true` in `game.multiplayer` (players must include 2, invites on), play the match from the launch below, and report the winner. |

### 15.2 The match launch

A ready match is the same as the better seed inviting the other player: the better
seed gets a **`host`** launch and the other a **`guest`** launch, sharing a two-player
party the hub forms for the match. Your existing invite handling (§6, §7) already
plays it: the host creates the room with `partyId` (hub rooms share it with the
party), the guest joins via `joinInfo`. The launch also carries:

```ts
launch.tournament = { id: number; title: string; match: string; opponent: PlayerLite | null };
```

Show it if you like ("Saturday Cup: your match against Sam"). A tournament match is
**one game**: don't offer "Play again" in its room, and when you leave a finished match
room before the next match's launch, open a new room for it (the old one has ended).

### 15.3 Reporting the winner

- **Hub rooms:** the room's host ends the match with the winner's hub user id as soon
  as the game is over: `room.end({ ...yourResults, winnerId })`. Only a `winnerId` of
  one of the two players counts; no `winnerId` (a draw, or a computer player won)
  leaves the match to the clock, which then settles it for the better seed.
- **Own-server games:** your server posts its trusted result with the launch's
  tournament: `hubServer.results({ players: [{ userId, won: true }, { userId }], tournament: { id, match } })`
  (the `hub-server.mjs` SDK; `POST /internal/results`). The client passes
  `launch.tournament` on to your server with the room it joins. Both players must be named and exactly one must have won.
- **Races:** nothing to do.

Reference: `apps-test/mpdemo` (the most clicks wins; `room.end({ count, winnerId })`),
and Clue (`src/online/match-result.ts`).

**Trust.** As with races, a hub room's result comes from its host's browser; the hub
checks that the winner is one of the match's players and decides each match once.
Own-server results are trusted (your server saw the game); race results are refereed
by the hub.

### 15.4 Testing

`HUB_LIMITS_JSON: '{"tournamentMinuteMs":1000}'` makes every tournament "minute"
(ready windows, warnings, reminders) last a second. The hub's
`test/e2e/tournaments.test.mjs` creates a quick 1v1 from the home page, signs a guest
up, plays the match in MP Demo, and lets a ready window run out.
